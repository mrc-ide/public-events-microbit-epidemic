# Microbit-epidemic: Documentation

Documentation is split into these parts:-

* [The Hardware Guide](docs/KIT.md) - regarding
the hardware we bought, how we put it together, and 
any particular experiences we had with it.

* [The User Guide](docs/USE.md) - how to run a micro:bit
epidemic in the wild.

* [The Implementation](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) - how it all
works, including the message protocols we use over the serial
port, and using the simple radio on the micro:bit.

* [The Compilation Guide](docs/COMPILING.md) - regarding how
to compile C code and flash a micro:bit with it on Windows. You
don't need to do this, as binaries are in this repo, but if you
want to change the code, or understand (or suggest improvements)
on how we did things, this is what we did.
