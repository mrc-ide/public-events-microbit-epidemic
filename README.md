# Microbit-epidemic: Documentation

Documentation is split into these parts:-

* [Hardware Guide](docs/KIT.md) - regarding
the hardware, assembly, and 
any particular experiences with it.

* [Preparation](docs/PREPARE.md) - basically about 
getting the software onto the microbits, and getting 
serial numbers and ids sorted out.

* [The User Guide](docs/USE.md) - how to run micro:bit
epidemic games in the wild.

* [The Implementation](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) - how it all
works, including the message protocols over the serial
port, and the simple micro:bit radio.

* [The Compilation Guide](docs/COMPILING.md) - The
micro:bit code is written in C, the management interface is in
Python, the slideshow, sticker printer, and multi-flashing tool
are in Java, and the network graph is generated in R. Compilation
details are in here, if you want to change the code, or understand 
(or suggest improvements) on how I did things.
