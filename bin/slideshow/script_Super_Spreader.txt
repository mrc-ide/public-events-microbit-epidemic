# How do I run RScript?
#######################

#On Windows:
RScript:C:\Program Files\R\R-3.3.3\bin\RScript.exe

#On Mac: 
#RScript:Rscript

#And what R script generates staticnetworkplot.png ?
RNetGraph:Outbreak7.R

# Now the Script section.

Script:

# Special Commands:
# Wait 10   - pause for a number of seconds
# CasesGraph - plot incidence over time. 
#              Optionally, you can add       Cumulative  - for a cumulative graph
#                               and/or       Unconfirmed - to also show unconfirmed cases (ie, barcode not yet returned on the graph).
#                                                          unreturned barcodes are either lost, or the owner is already immune.
# R0Graph    - plot an R0 graph.
#              Optinally, you can add        Unconfirmed - to also show unconfirmed cases (ie, worst-case R0 if all barcodes cause cases)
#
# GenTimeGraph - plot a distribution of generation time. (What % of people make their contact within a certain time)
#
#
# NetworkGraph - Display the latest network graph. (And also launched the update script, which might take a little while as the epidemic
#                grows, so the network graph may lag one cycle behind the other images.
#
# Movie["path_to_movie1.mp4","path_to_movie2.mp4"]   -   Display one of these specified movies on each run through the script.
#
# Image["path_to_image1.png","path_to_image2.png"]   -   Similar but with an image.
