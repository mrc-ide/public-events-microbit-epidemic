# public-events-microbit-epdemic: Usage - running an epidemic!

So far, you've bought, built and glued the hardware, installed Python, Java and R,
possibly upgraded the mBed firmware in the micro:bits, flashed 100 or so with the 
minion firmware, and another one with the master firmware. It's been quite an 
emotional and character building experience. You've got a serial port driver installed 
(if you're on windows), and you've got some/all your micro:bits identified with an id
between 0 and 99. You're now ready to run some epidemic games.


### Use the python GUI
From the root of this repo, in a command window. Assuming you have python installed...
```
cd python-gui
python epi_manager.py
```

There are instructions in the bottom left of each stage...
